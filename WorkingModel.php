                       every marginalized child and hence programmes must be designed accordingly</p>

                    Donors and resources:</b> We get the funds for our NGO's activities 
                from the privileged side of our community who voluntarily wish to donate for the education of
                 the children. Our new policy is planned to be "one child, one donor" where we want every
                 child under the NGO to be virtually adopted by a donor.</p></li>

                 helping them to realize the importance of education for everyone so they can co-operate
                  with us in reaching our goals. Not only getting them to send their kids to study rather
                   than sending them for trifle works, Pehchaan succeeded in making the parents help convert
                    their learning ground provided by another
                 child education supportist into a jhuggi Pathshala.</p></li>
