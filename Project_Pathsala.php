   It is important to continuously monitor every child individually, 
   tutions are conducted every day at place near to their (children's) home.
    Groups are created among volunteers and each group is assigned one day in a week,
     in which thursday is a given holiday. The tutions are conducted for 1 hrs 30 min
      from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Children are divided into two groups namely Shera and Tiger
       according to their education levels. Our future project, this year, under this program

        In this sessions along with education, individual growth is also
         taken care off. Meetings are scheduled frequently by the volunteers with children’s
          parents to access the child activities which help the volunteers to guide then 
          accordingly. Moral values,
         life skills are also taught in this sessions that would help in developing their personality.

        Noticing the difficulties faced by the children’s parents to afford
         basic stationery such as pens, notebooks, pencils, easers, bags etc they are
          bought and given to children by the Pehchaan team from the funds received. It
           is observed that by providing them the children are feeling motivated to
         study thereby actively indulging themselves in these sessions.
